# Thunix Wiki

Editing the wiki documents is easy.  They are all stored in ./articles, and are all markdown format.

If you're feeling froggy, you can also do PR's for the code running the wiki, style sheets, etc etc.

Support files (Header, footer, site.css) are in ./includes.

So, to update the wiki, just submit a PR for it :)
