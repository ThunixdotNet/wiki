# What is Git?

### Definitions:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Git Definition, explained by git itself.](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [In a broader sense:](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/source-control/)

### Definition in summary
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, the point of Git/SCM's is to keep track of changes to any file, project, or workspace in an enviroment offsite where you can view, manage, revert, and effectively maintain said items.

Example. Say you wanted to make a simple website from scratch. Git would allow you to take every change, or a group of changes, and make these into updates; called commits. These commits store data of everything inside the repository(a fancy word for workspace/project) from the start, allowing you to watch how a project grows. This record allows you to keep backups of your project, in case you lose it locally. It even allows you to undo changes in the event a new change causes issues. 

Honestly, you could go on and **on** and ***on*** about how git can enhance the way you work on projects. Where it REALLY shines though is when you group together with other individuals and work together! Git allows MANY people to work on the same project. If a change is made, these users can store their earlier progress, and pull the new changes made!(more on this later.) This entire system builds an ecosystem; where work is done efficiently and effectively.

For example. THIS ENTIRE WIKI is a Git Repository! Every contributor works together to build this project! We all come together to build you a central place to find guides and things. How nice and handy, right? I mean having a *full guide* of things like contribing and git; all in one place, with nice and pretty text?!? Fucking awesome.
