## SSH and Thunix (And magic!) 

When you [sign up](https://www.thunix.net/signup.php) for an account on thunix, you'll be given remote access to a Linux shell server, with web hosting, gopher hosting and email. And because of our [GDPR and privacy policy](https://www.thunix.net/gdpr.php), we take security seriously. This is why we use SSH key pairs to grant access to our server through SSH or SFTP.

On our signup page, you'll seen an entry for a "Public SSH Key." SSH key pairs work on the basis of having two files; one is a public key that you can send to us when we create your account, while the other is a private key that you keep on your computer, away from public knowledge.
