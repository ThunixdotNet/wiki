## Your Thunix Email

Every thunix account comes with a functional and encrypted email address. This email is the same as your SSH login name. However, you will need to set a password on your thunix SSH account, using the PASSWD command in BASH. Though your SSH account will have a password, this will NOT affect how you log into your account using SSH or an SFTP client, as your public/private key pair will always work. The account password, however, will affect your thunix email address.

Your email can be accessed in one of three ways:

1. Running the Mutt email client through your SSH account
2. Logging into your email account from our [web mail](https://www.thunix.net/webmail/) service
3. Through an email client program installed on your computer, using IMAP
