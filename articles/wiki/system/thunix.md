       * deepend  - Email: deepend@thunix.net

DESCRIPTION Thunix is a publicly accesible Linux server, running Debian
9, and managed using ansible playbooks.

       There  are  many  optional things to do on Thunix.  There is IRC chat availble with the weechat client.  Most build tools are available to you as well, to include
       git, make, gcc, go, python, and perl.  Mail facilties are also available for you to use via alpine, mutt, or even mailx.

       To enter chat, just type 'chat' and hit enter.  You'll be dropped into the #thunix chat room on the irc.tilde.chat network.

       You should create an account at tildegit.org, where Thunix's git repos are hosted, to include the system configuration definition files.

       Ansible is the tool we use to configure the systems that comprise Thunix.  Git and ansible are two tools your should familiarize yourself with.

Purpose The goal of Thunix is to be an open and collaborative
environment, conducive to learning the principles of \*Nix operating
systems, regarding how they work, how to administer them, how to use
them, and how to collaborate using them.

       Thunix tries to adhere to the values and philosophy of the Hacker Ethic whenever possible. The hacker ethics and beliefs as described by Levy are:

            *  Access  to  computers  -  and  anything which might teach you something about the way the world works - should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the
       Hands-On Imperative!

            * All information should be free

            * Mistrust authority - promote decentralization

            * Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not criteria such as degrees, age, race, sex, or position

            * You can create art and beauty on a computer

            * Computers can change your life for the better

       Thunix will never use proprietary software but users can do that if they wish. This is something they should avoid however.

Architecture The Thunix system consists of one server, running Debian 9,
which runs inside of an LXD container. This allows for an out-of-band
administration of the host, in case of configuration-gone-awry.

       Hourly, thunix reaches out to tildegit, pull down the latest version of the configuration, and run the configuration tool, ensuring it is in a known,  and  easily
       replicable state.

       All repos for system configuration, Thunix-supplied/ran code is hosted on tildegit.org.  Thunix users are recommended to create accounts on tildegit, and contrib‐
       ute pull requests to make their desired changes to the system, or very minimally, submit issues for problems and/or requests.
