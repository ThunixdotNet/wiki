NAME chat - chat script

SYNOPSIS chat

DESCRIPTION This is a simple script to launch weechat for new users, and
get them into the correct channel for chat and support.

BUGS \* If you have a customized list of servers in your weechat config
already, this may try to connect you twice, and you'll have two nicks
going at once, which will be confusing. Once you've customized weechat
to your liking, just invoke 'weechat' or 'weechat-curses'.
